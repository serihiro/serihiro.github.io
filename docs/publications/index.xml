      <description>The slide of this talk
The training dataset used in deep neural networks (DNNs) keeps on increasing. When a training dataset grows larger, the reading performance of such a large training dataset becomes a problem. A high-performance computing (HPC) cluster has high performance I/O storage devices, for example, NVMe SSD, as local storage on each compute node. This high-performance I/O storage can mitigate the I/O bottleneck. However, such storage devices provide only temporary storage, therefore the users have to copy the training dataset from shared storage (such as Lustre) into local storage.</description>
